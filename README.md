# small.sample
This R package is able to generate a small sample of representative
points that retain the characteristics of a chosen distribution better
than independent sampling.

The figure below shows the first four moments of 10,000 samples of size
30 generated from a standard normal distribution. The red dots correspond
to samples generated using small.sample; the grey dots correspond to IID
samples.
